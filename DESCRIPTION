Description: Implements the deconvolution algorithm developed in Mauri, 
    Vecchione, and Fritz (2019) which enables deconvolution of luminscence 
    readings for experimental culture plates. {reluxr} provides functions for 
    calculating the 'best' deconvolution matrix from a calibration plate, and 
    enables usage of this calibration matrix (or one calculated previously) to 
    adjust experimental values from a plate reader.
